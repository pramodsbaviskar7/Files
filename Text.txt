Dear Candidates,

We are excited to invite you to participate in an assignment that involves building a Gen AI-based solution to extract standalone and consolidated financial statements from PDF documents and convert them into structured JSON format.

Objective: Create a solution to extract standalone and consolidated financial statements from the provided PDF in JSON format using only freely available resources.

Instructions:

PDF Files: We have attached PDF files containing standalone and consolidated financial statements, along with sample input and output JSON files for your reference.

Solution Requirements:

Extract standalone and consolidated financial statements accurately.

Convert the extracted data into structured JSON format.

Use only freely available tools, libraries, models, APIs, or methods.

Provide proper code to ensure that test cases can be performed seamlessly.

Submission Requirements:

Mandatory: Provide the entire code base, including an inference file to perform test cases.

You can submit via:

Entire code base with an inference file.

Git link (GitHub or any other platform).

Streamlit app link (Code base submission is still required).

Include JSON output samples for both standalone and consolidated financial statements.

Provide documentation explaining the tools used, steps to run the solution, and challenges faced.

Additional Notes:

The code should be generalized to accommodate most cases.

Attached PDF files and JSON responses are provided for reference to help you understand the data that needs to be extracted.

We look forward to your submissions and appreciate your efforts in tackling this task.


Note:

Since we will be performing test cases on your solution, please ensure that your code is generalized to handle most scenarios and variations in financial statement formats.
Some pdf may only contain  standalone of consolidated
